# FreeCodeCamp JavaScript

I have been learning JavaScript from the [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.org/) and it has been an awesome learning journey for me. The JavaScript curriculum offered by FreeCodeCamp has two specific sections for utilizing the learning skills via some programming questions.
The sections are denoted as

- [Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/)
- [Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting/)

This repository contains the individual exercises provided under each of these sections.

Apart from that, I am keeping the regular notes of my learning via blog posts. You may find the blog posts at my [blog](gutsytechster.wordpress.com) or refer to my [dev.to](https://dev.to/gutsytechster) profile.
